# Neon Take-Home Test

Hey there! Welcome to my Real-Time Data Replication project. This is part of the Neon take-home test, where Iâ€™m tackling both conceptual questions and a technical implementation.

## Project Breakdown

1. **Customer Questions**: Iâ€™ve answered some hypothetical questions about latency, logical replication, and more. You can find all that [here](questions.md).

2. **Technical Implementation**: Iâ€™ve documented my approach to setting up outbound logical replication from Neon to another Postgres service, along with the Node.js app that displays the replicated data. Check it out [here](technical.md).
